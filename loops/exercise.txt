#1 — Print the numbers from 0 to 15
#2 — Print the numbers from 12 to 24
#3 — Print the ODD numbers from 7 to 31
#4 — Print the EVEN numbers from 10 to -20
#5 — Iterate through all numbers from 1 to 45. Print the following:
        For multiples of 3 print “Fizz”
        For multiples of 5 print “Buzz”
        For multiples of 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”
#6 — Print all the elements of the following array
#7 — Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the following array
#8 - Get the sum of two arrays…actually the sum of all their elements.
    P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

    let arr_1 = [3, 5, 22, 5,  7,  2,  45, 75, 89, 21, 2]; // --> 276
    let arr_2 = [9, 2, 42, 55, 71, 22, 4,  5,  90, 25, 26]; // --> 351
    // Example output: 
    // 276 + 351 = 627
#9 - Using a for loop output the elements in reverse order

    let arr = [43, "what", 9, true, "cannot", false, "be", 3, true];
    // Example output: 
    // [true, 3.5,  "be",  false, "cannot",  true, 9, "what", 43] OR each item on a new line
#10 - Given two arrays of integers. Add up each element in the same position and
    create a new array containing the sum of each pair. Assume both arrays are of the same length.
    
    let arr_3   = [4, 6, 7];
    let arr_4    = [8, 1, 9];
    // Example output: 
    // [12, 7, 16]
#11 - Given a string change the every second letter to an uppercase ‘Z’. Assume
    there are no space.

    let str1 = "javascript";  
    // Example output: 
    // jZvZsZrZpZ OR each letter on a new line
    // HINT: You can use  if((i+1) % 2 == 0) to check for even indexes 
#12 - Check if a string contains the letter “y”. Print “yes” if it does and “no” if it does not.

    let str2 = "don’t know why";
    // Example output: 
    // “yes”
